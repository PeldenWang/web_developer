    <p>Web design is the process of preparation, forming a concept, and organizing content online. Today, drafting a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website’s overall performance. Web design also includes web apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.
        When designing a website it’s important to consider both the site’s presentation and features. Coordinating these ingredients will maximize the site’s overall operation and production.
        
        A website is like an online store for your business. It is a place where potential customers can learn about your products or services and contact you to purchase them. A website also allows you to connect with existing customers and build relationships with new ones.
